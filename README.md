# College-Login-System
This is a full stack project using PHP at backend, Bootstrap at front end, MySQL as the data base using Apache server. The students can sign-up for the first time and all the details will be mailed to the student mail id provided. The form will only be submitted after the form validation is done in every input places. Once the account is created, the student can sign-in; any wrong password or username will not be provided access to the next page. Only when the password and username matches the next logged in page will be shown. In the logged in page, the student can check their respective profile and can change the password by 2 way- One by using OTP method where the otp would be sent to the registered student email id and on entering the correct OTP, the password would be allowed to change, The other method being the user id method were on entering the correct user id, the password could be changed but in both the cases, the new password cannot be same as the old password. The ADMIN can login and has the access to each other student whose data has been stored in the data base and can edit/delete if any changes are required. Data tables was used so that we can easily download the data shown to the ADMIN in PDF/CSV/EXCEL format. This project was made by me in my second year during my FULL STACK PHP course.
